Problem: Online forms are widely used to gather information from users for a wide range of purposes such as 
creating an account, submitting a support request, or making a purchase. The assignment is to create the 
validation and processor for an input form, using the standard GUI form fields. 

Our form will be used to process and validate user inputs from a graphical user interface (GUI). We do not know what the client code or the GUI looks like, so the program is designed to accept different input types. This project applies the following Object Oriented Programming concepts:
  1. Generics, 
  2. Inheritance,
  3. Polymorphism, and
  4. Abstraction.
