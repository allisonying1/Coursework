Problem: Online forms are widely used to gather information from users for a wide range of purposes such as 
creating an account, submitting a support request, or making a purchase. The assignment is to create the 
validation and processor for an input form, using the standard GUI form fields. 

We are creating a form that will be used to process and validate user inputs from a graphical user interface. 
We do not know what the client code or the GUI looks like, so we need to create a form that can accept 
different input types. This program applies the following Object Oriented Programming concepts:
  1. Generics, 
  2. Inheritance,
  3. Polymorphism, and
  4. Abstraction.
