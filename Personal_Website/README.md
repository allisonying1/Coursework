# Project 1: Personal Webiste- AllisonYing

Heroku Link: https://lissonying.herokuapp.com/

For my personal webpage, I created a digital portfolio. Each page has two gif features: (1) a header that resizes based on Desktop/ Mobile screen
dimensions, and (2) a moving sticker that continues throughout the entire body of the page. Each page also has 2 navigation bars (top and bottom of the page, implemented using inline lists) and a suprise button that will take them to a external youtube link for a music video. I will go into more detail about the features for each of the individual pages below:

Page 1: Home/ index.html

This is the first page that the user will see when they go to my page. For desktop users, there is a letter to the reader, which is originally set to a grayscale filter and sized so that it is hard for the user to read. However, if the user hovers over the note, the filter is set back to original and the note will expand so that the letter is legible. For mobile users, the letter is scaled and set to no filter, so that they won't have to hover to read the letter. The letter has instructions for navigating the page. If the user decides to click on my name, it will change colors (implemented using jquery).

Page 2: About Me/ about.html

I couldn't fit the entire page into my screenshot, but there is a header at the top of this page as well. I have a brief bio that states my background, interests, and links to my LinkedIn and Github. Underneath that, I implemented an Image Gallery. When the user clicks on one of the pictures, it changes the caption above and below the gallery (implemented using JavaScript). If the user is on desktop, the frames will expand when the user hovers their mouse over the images.

Page 3: My Poems/ poetry.html

The falling rose petal backdrop made some of the text difficult to read, so I made sure that all of my texts have a white background. On the desktop, if the user hovers over the poems, it triggers a grayscale filter over the frame. Clicking on an image opens up a new tab, so the user can read it separately.

Page 4: Videos/ videoC.html

<img width="841" alt="image" src="https://media.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/user/9106/files/739c977d-7917-48dd-9ca7-a530dbcc022e">

I used the iframe tag to insert the videos into the table cells. Users also have the option to open the video in a new page- in case the current display is too small. I used Google drive to host these videos.

Page 5: Media Credits/ cited.html

<img width="911" alt="image" src="https://media.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/user/9106/files/0b623221-e115-4dfa-9501-c835b71d4678">

This is the only page that doesn't have a header image. I used the same table template to give credit to the free-use media sources that I included throughout my pages.
