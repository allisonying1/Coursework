## **Mission Statement:** 
Pleasant Pedal is a web application designed for Seattle-based cyclists, from beginner to expert, who are unhappy with the crowds on popular trails and find the optimal times to ride when trails are free from other riders and pedestrians. Our interactive platform is designed with the following goals in mind: 
1. enhanced planning capabilities for cyclists, 
2. improved safety on shared roads, and 
3. promoting healthy exercise and environmentally friendly transport. 
For new cyclists who want to avoid the judgment of advanced cyclists or for avid cyclists who want free range of the trail, our web application will make it easier to enjoy the open safe trails, so you can focus on peddling pleasantly.

## **Data Insights on Multi-Use Trails**

**Top 5 Busiest Bike Trails:**
1. Lake Union Loop (ranked Intermediate)
2. Hiram M. Chittenden Locks (ranked Beginner)
3. Burke Gilman- Ballard to Bothell (ranked Advanced)
4. I-90 Trail (ranked Advanced)
5. Alki Trail (ranked Intermediate)

**Top 5 Months with the most Bike Activity**
1. May
2. July
3. August
4. June
5. April

Our data further shows that the Myrtle Edwards to Elliot Bay Park (ranked as a Beginner trail) is one of the more popular trails for pedestrians, possibly due to its waterfront location, views of the mountain-ranges, and the nearby tourist attractions. On the other hand, the I-90 Trail (ranked as an Advanced trail) is less popular amongst pedestrians, potentially due to heavy bike and car traffic. 

Crime and Biking trends can be seasonal. Our data shows that the peak biking seasons fall somewhere between April-August, possibly due to the warmer weather and better biking conditions. There is some overlap between the peak months for crime, which is some time between July-December. Crime rates can also be attributed to the intense fluctuations in weather that tends to occur during Fall-Winter seasons. 

Businesses that are related to “All Other Transit And Ground Passenger Transportation” that are near trails have more bikers and pedestrians. Rainier Beach, Leschi, Sand Point, Capitol Hill, Ballard, and Fremont provide the most transit and ground passenger transportation services for commuters. Bike infrastructure tends to be more common and better maintained (by the city) in commuter-heavy neighborhoods. 

Higher temperatures within weather types show more pedestrians and bikers on trails. The ideal biking temperature is around 26 degrees celsius. Popular biking months fall somewhere between Spring and Summer. Biking activity increases during Sunny weather, though Rain does not seem to be a major deterrent for Seattle Bikers. This could be influenced by Seattle’s general weather conditions, which is often rainy. Local bikers might have a higher tolerance for this type of weather. 

## **Data Collection and Extraction:**
Limitations of using pre-existing Databases/ Data
1. City of Seattle has approx. 11 Bike and Pedestrian counter programs located in 11 different neighborhoods. This does not give us a truly accurate representation of the available bike trails in Seattle. 
2. Pedestrian Counter data might not be very reliable, seems to be an under-representation of total pedestrian traffic. 
3. Counters are located at specific coordinate points on a trail and does not give a full-representation of the entire trail traffic. 
4. Some of the counter programs are newer than others and might not have as much total data as other counters. For certain operations, we had to minimize the date windows for comparisons.
5. We had to generate our own mock user dataset. Though this was useful for testing operations, it wasn’t an actual representation of user motivations and application engagement.

## **Value Proposition Reflection:**
The primary objectives as stated in our Value Proposition was achieved in the following ways.
1. Enhanced planning capabilities for cyclists: Our application provides users with information on the trails available in the City of Seattle and enables the users to leverage traffic data to plan their ideal ride. 
2. Improved safety on shared roads: Having studied the crime data from the Trail Neighborhoods, our platform gives the user realistic safety expectations to be had of these trails.
3. Promoting healthy exercise and environmentally friendly transport: Cyclists have their own personal incentives for biking. We believe that our users, no matter their motivations, are all investing in healthy exercising and sustainable transport to some extent.
